# Password Generator

## Description 

I'll create a Password generator app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript code that I will write. My app will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters.
